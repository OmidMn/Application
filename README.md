      Windows Form

I made this application using C# programming language and also Python for a little bit. Actually It was my first C# Windows Form projects which was my school homework, too. As I mentioned In description, It has some different options such as Calculator, Exam simulator, Speed game, web browser and so on. Of course in the future I'll add some more parts but you can also fork It if you want to add some more options, fix possible bugs or even if you have any idea you can implement it

You can use these sources to achieve the thing that you are trying to find or even solve your problems. I mean you can use Microsoft main pages to do your C# tasks and Python.org for api part, but there are some other popular sites that you can find your answers as easy as abc! sometimes you try really hard to find something that you can't find in these sites! In this case I recommend you watching related youtube videos, or some other times the company has some special videos talking about the topic. For example google prepared some films talking about how to make mobile applications using flutter and so on ...

## About Windows Form ###
<p align="justify">
Windows Forms is a UI framework for building Windows desktop apps. It provides one of the most productive ways to create desktop apps based on the visual designer provided in Visual Studio. Functionality such as drag-and-drop placement of visual controls makes it easy to build desktop apps. With Windows Forms, you develop graphically rich apps that are easy to deploy, update, and work while offline or while connected to the internet. Windows Forms apps can access the local hardware and file system of the computer where the app is running. Windows Forms is a UI technology for .NET, a set of managed libraries that simplify common app tasks such as reading and writing to the file system. When you use a development environment like Visual Studio, you can create Windows Forms smart-client apps that display information, request input from users, and communicate with remote computers over a network.

## Windows Form Browser ###

In fact, web scraping is often the only way we can access data. There is a lot of information out there that isn’t available in convenient CSV exports or easy-to-connect APIs. And websites themselves are often valuable sources of data — consider, for example, the kinds of analysis you could do if you could download every post on a web forum. But many websites with useful data don’t offer these convenient options. Consider, for example, the National Weather Service’s website. It contains up-to-date weather forecasts for every location in the US, but that weather data isn’t accessible as a CSV or via API. As previously mentioned, it’s possible to do web scraping with many programming languages. However, one of the most popular approaches is to use Python and the Beautiful Soup library.
